# Neural Network from Scratch

This documentation describes a simple neural network implementation built from scratch in C++. The implementation includes the fundamental building blocks of neural networks:

- `Value`: A computational graph node that tracks gradients for automatic differentiation
- `Neuron`: A single neuron with weights, bias, and activation function
- `Layer`: A collection of neurons
- `MLP`: A multi-layer perceptron composed of multiple layers
